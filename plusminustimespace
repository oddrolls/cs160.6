TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY

TIME - 
The major thing with the time complexity in PlusMinus is the for loop, which loops through the size of the array. Since the for loop
increases constantly, the time complexity of PlusMinus is O(n), since its runtime scales with the size of the input.

SPACE - 
I did not solve PlusMinus recursively because I had to dedicate all my brainpower to IceCreamParlor2, so since there are no recursive
calls the space complexity is constant, or O(1).
